examples/	various example inputs to the program

To run the examples, execute

	./golok <example file>

You probably want to use GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org)
to convert the .dot output files to images. Then you can 
run a command like

	dot -Tsvg -o pretty_picture.svg golok_output.dot

to see the simulating subgraph of the solution as an svg 
graphic.
