Please include "[Golok]" in the subject line.

INSTALL
-------
Unpack golok-vx.x.tar.bz2.

The binary was built on a Fedora 10 (Cambridge) x86 machine.
It *should* work on most modern x86 GNU/Linux distributions.
   
To run an example and output the simulating subset of the 
system instance, execute

	./golok --sys <example file>

You probably want to use GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org)
to convert the .dot output files to images. Then you can 
run a command like

	dot -Tsvg -o pretty_picture.svg golok_output.dot

to see the simulating subgraph of the solution as an svg 
graphic.

Execute 

  ./golok --help 

to see all command line options, and see the documentation
at http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~slede/golok/ for more 
detailed usage of the tool.
